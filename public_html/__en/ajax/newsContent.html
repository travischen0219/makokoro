                            The rivalry between Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo has dominated the back-page headlines -- not just in Spain, but across the world -- thanks to their phenomenal goalscoring feats.<br>

Since their season started in August, Portugal captain Ronaldo -- who won his third World Player of the Year award in January -- is on top with 50 goals in all competitions.<br>

Argentina skipper Messi is not far behind, with the four-time Ballon d'Or winner scoring a total of 46 goals in the same period for his club.<br>

Ronaldo's tally means he has already equaled the number of goals he scored last season.<br>

Goals from the UEFA Super Cup (USC), Copa Del Rey (CDR), the European Champions League (CL) and La Liga (LIGA) are listed below in chronological order -- and with more matches left to play, it's still anyone's game.
